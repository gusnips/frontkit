 * disk, and keeping the four impure functions together is what lets `head.ts`, `sitemap.ts`,
 * `render.ts` and `og.ts` stay that way.
 *
 * The prerender LOOP is not here. Every donor's loop is different — one walks a registry once,
 * another walks it per locale, a third writes three separate shells — and all of that is
 * policy the product owns. What is identical in every one of them is these four functions and
 * the gate in `assertRendered`, so those ship and the ~40-line loop stays in the app.

 * brand card is correct, so it has no way to tell a right image from a wrong one (invariant 12).
 * The build can, because by then the cards are either on disk or they are not. Run it last,
 * after the pages and the cards are written:
 *
 * ```ts
 * await assertOgImages("dist", "https://example.com");
