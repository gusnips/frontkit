/**
 * The build-time half of a prerendered Vite + React SPA.
 *
 * A Vite SPA ships one `index.html` and draws the rest with JavaScript. Nothing that reads a
 * link for a living runs that bundle — not a search crawler, not an LLM, not the thing that
 * draws the preview card in a chat app. So the build renders every public route to a real file
 * with a real `<head>` and a real body, and this is the part every app doing that shares.
 *
 * Four repos wrote it independently and each learned something the others had not. What is
 * here is the merge; every non-obvious rule carries the reason it exists.
 *
 * Three things live behind their own subpath, because each drags a dependency this barrel would
 * otherwise force on everyone: the vite config preset at `@gusnips/vite/preset` (the React and
 * Tailwind plugins), `renderTree` at `@gusnips/vite/render`, and the theme pre-paint plugin at
 * `@gusnips/vite/theme` (both React itself). Nothing here
 * imports React or vite, so a prerender script, an OG generator and a repo that only wants a
 * sitemap all install exactly what they use.
