/**
 * Platform-purity check.
 *
 * Lifted from a donor's `packages/shared/scripts/check-purity.ts`, which already had the
 * shape and the reason: **tsc cannot promise this.** A root-level `@types/node` is visible
 * to every workspace, so a stray `import { readFile } from "node:fs"` inside `react/`
 * typechecks fine and then blows up in a browser bundle. Only reading the source catches it.
 *
 * The rule per package IS the package split, restated as a test:
 *
 *   http/    no Node, no browser globals. The API server, the browser and the SDK all
 *            compile it unchanged; anything platform-shaped breaks one of the three.
 *   react/   no Node. Browser globals are the point — but see the SSR note below.
 *   vite/    unrestricted. It is the only package allowed `node:fs`, and having somewhere
 *            for that to live is the reason the other three can be strict.
 *
 * What this does NOT catch, and no grep can: a browser global read at MODULE SCOPE inside
 * `react/`, which crashes a prerender rather than a bundle. One donor's `themeStore.ts` was the
 * live example — `localStorage` inside `create()`, evaluated at import, so blocked site data
 * threw before React mounted and no ErrorBoundary could catch it. Module-scope browser access
 * is a review rule, checked by eye at every extraction.
 *
 * Run: bun run scripts/check-purity.ts
