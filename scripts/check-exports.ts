/**
 * Entry-point weight check — invariant 15, stated as something a machine can fail.
 *
 * **The rule: a peer marked `optional` must not be reachable from the package's main entry.**
 *
 * An optional peer the barrel imports anyway is not optional. It is a required peer whose error
 * moved from install time (where a package manager explains it) to the adopter's first build
 * (where a bundler says "failed to resolve import" and names our file, not their missing
 * install). That is strictly the worse of the two places to find out.
 *
 * This has now happened four times, twice in our own code. Each earlier one was found by hand:
 * `hydrate.ts` sat in `react/`'s barrel beside two string constants, so a build script reading
 * `PRERENDERED_ROUTE_ATTR` loaded `react-dom/client`; `renderTree` sat in `vite/`'s, so a script
 * that only wanted `sitemapXml` loaded `react-dom/static.browser`. The fourth was `zustand` and
 * `react-router-dom` in `@gusnips/react`, both declared optional and both imported unconditionally
 * by the one entry point everybody uses.
 *
 * Why this reads `dist/` and not `src/`: a type-only re-export looks identical in source and
 * disappears at runtime. `export type { PageRenderer } from "./render.ts"` costs nothing;
 * `export { renderTree } from "./render.ts"` loads React. Reading the source answers a different
 * question than the one that matters, so this walks the BUILT graph. It follows relative imports
 * only — a bare specifier is where the walk stops and the finding starts.
 *
 * Also checks that every path in every `exports` map points at a file that exists, because a
 * typo there is invisible until someone installs the package and cannot import it.
 *
 * Run: bun run scripts/check-exports.ts   (after a build — the gate does that first)
