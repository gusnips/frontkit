/**
 * react-query defaults — the merge of three repos that each got part of this right.
 *
 * The default is three blind retries, which is wrong for an API that answers refusals
 * precisely: a 402, a 403 or a 451 says exactly the same thing three times, and a 429 we hammer
 * is a 429 we deserve. All three donors knew that much. What each knew alone:
 *
 * - one allowed **408** through, the only 4xx that a second attempt genuinely fixes;
 * - one refused to retry a 429 whose CODE says the limit is durable — a monthly quota or a
 *   spent balance clears by buying, not by waiting, so retrying burns another request against
 *   the limiter and cannot succeed;
 * - one set **`refetchOnReconnect`**, which none of the others had, and which is the single
 *   most useful refetch there is: coming back from a tunnel is exactly when the screen is stale.
 *
 * The second migration added the fourth rule, which no donor had: **when a 429 says how long,
 * believe it.** Its limiter answers `Retry-After: 60` on a per-minute window, and the default
 * backoff retries at 1s and 2s — two more requests that cannot succeed, both charged against the
 * same limiter, and three seconds added before the screen says anything. So a stated wait is
 * waited out when it is short, and is an ANSWER when it is not.
 *
 * The fifth rule came from the server half of this fleet rather than from a donor: a refusal can
 * state that waiting will never fix it at all, by sending `details.retryAfterSecs: null`. Read as
 * "did not say how long" — which is what every version before this one did — that 429 is retried
 * against a limit no amount of time moves.
 *
 * This is invariant 8. The rule itself lives in `@gusnips/http/retry`, so an SDK with no React
 * in it follows the same one; what is here is the binding to react-query.

/**
 * What a screen should show for one query: still waiting, failed with nothing to show, or ready.
 * When it is ready, `refreshError` says whether the last refresh failed.
 *
 * **Never gate a screen on `isError`.** It is also true when a BACKGROUND refetch fails over data
 * already on screen — a window regaining focus, a poll, the invalidation after a save — so
 * `isError ? <failure panel> : <data>` throws away what the reader was looking at over one blip.
 * The adopters that had noticed each wrote `isLoadingError` beside a comment saying so; the ones
 * that had not were a boundary and a great many inline ternaries. A refresh that failed is not a
 * page that failed: the data is still real, and `refreshError` is there to say it may be stale.
 *
 * `waiting` is anything with no data and no error, and that includes a query switched off until
 * something upstream answers. `isLoading` is false there, because it means `isPending &&
 * isFetching`, which is how `isLoading ? <spinner> : <list>` shows an empty list as though the
 * answer were "nothing".
 *
 * Only `data` and `error` are read, and that is react-query's own definition, not a shortcut:
 * every success clears `error`, and a refetch after a failed first load goes back to pending. So
 * an error beside data IS `isRefetchError`, and an error without data IS `isLoadingError`. It
 * takes any query result, infinite ones included, and a test passes a plain object.
 *
 * A missing `error` counts as none. react-query always sends `null`, but a hook that merges two
 * queries can send `undefined`, and a screen must not report a failed refresh for that.
 *
 * Which control to offer is not decided here. Hand the error to the describer: its `recover` comes
 * from the same rule the query client retries by, so the button and the retry cannot disagree.
