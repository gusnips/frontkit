 * Two donors wrote these four, gave two of them the same names, and explained them in nearly

 * reason this file exists rather than being copied a ninth time.
 *
 * These are factories because the destinations are the app's: `paths.signIn` is not something a
 * package can know, and one donor hardcoded `/login` in four places for exactly that reason.
 *
 * A guard is a COURTESY, never the boundary. The API refuses what it refuses whatever any of
 * these decide. What they buy is that somebody who types a URL lands on one screen that
 * explains itself instead of four panels each failing separately.

 * This shape is invariant 4. A guard reading `!me?.isStaff` collapses "pending", "failed" and
 * "no" into one branch — so an operator arriving while `/auth/me` is 500ing is told the page
 * does not exist. Wrong cause, no retry, and no request id to quote to support. One donor hit
 * that and fixed it; the other still has the collapsed version.
 *
 * `"pending"` and not `"loading"` for one measured reason: it is react-query's own word for this
 * state since v5, and with the words matching a `UseQueryResult<TMe>` satisfies this type
 * STRUCTURALLY — `createRequireProfile(useMe, …)` takes the hook directly, no adapter. With
 * `"loading"` it does not typecheck and every adopter hand-writes the same six-line mapping;
 * eight of the twelve repos this serves are on react-query, and the first migration wrote that
 * mapping before anyone noticed. Nothing here imports react-query at runtime — the type stays
 * structural, so an app on SWR or a plain `useState` still answers it in three lines.
