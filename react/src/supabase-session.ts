/**
 * Auth FAILED rather than answered, so nothing is known about the credential it was handed:
 * either the request never landed, or GoTrue failed on its own.
 *
 * This is the question every site that ends a session has to ask — a token refresh, an API
 * door, and a callback choosing between "try again" and "that link is spent". Without it one
 * bad minute at GoTrue signs out everybody whose token happened to need refreshing, and tells
 * everybody clicking a recovery link that it has expired, which sends them to ask the service
 * that is down for a replacement.
 *
 * Both clauses carry weight, and the second is why this is a function rather than one call.
 * `isAuthRetryableFetchError` is a NAME check, and the statuses that earn that name are a list
 * auth-js owns. The list has drifted — 502, 503 and 504 at 2.91; those plus the 52x family and
 * still no 500 at 2.106; 500 through 530 at 2.108 — so code leaning on it alone is right at
 * whichever version happens to be installed, which is not the same as being right, and a fleet
 * installs several versions at once. It is also a LIST rather than a range, so it has holes at
 * every version, drift or no drift: at 2.112 nothing covers 505 through 519 or 531 up, and a
 * 507 or a 599 with a JSON body arrives as a plain `AuthApiError`. Pinning a recent SDK does not
 * make the status clause redundant.
 *
 * The same statuses with a body that is NOT JSON — a proxy's HTML page — arrive as an
 * `AuthUnknownError`, which carries no status at any status, so nothing here can tell that 507
 * from a malformed 400. It answers false for both, on purpose: reading an unreadable 4xx as an
 * outage would leave a dead session retrying forever, which is the other half of the same bug.
 *
 * Read the version a tree really serves with `bun why @supabase/auth-js`, which prints one
 * heading per RESOLVED version; `node_modules` keeps copies the resolver does not serve.
 *
 * Anything that is not an auth error at all answers true: a failure from outside auth-js is not
 * a verdict on the credential either. Nothing at all answers false — `null` is what every
 * supabase-js auth call returns on success, and success is not an outage.

/**
 * Signs out, and makes sure the session leaves this device even when auth cannot be reached.
 *
 * `auth.signOut()` alone does not. In two cases it resolves `{ error }` and keeps the stored
 * session. Both were measured on nine auth-js versions from 2.106.2 to 2.117.2; run
 * `bun why @supabase/auth-js` to see which one you have:
 *
 * - The access token has expired, or is close enough to expiring that auth-js refreshes it
 *   first, and the network is down. The refresh fails and `signOut()` returns that error before
 *   it touches storage. This happens at every version, and it is the common case: a laptop that
 *   wakes up offline with a tab still open.
 * - Before 2.110.2, the token is still good but `/logout` gets no answer. `signOut()` returns
 *   before it removes anything. `scope: "local"` does not help, because it calls `/logout` too.
 *
 * Either way a reload reads the session and signs the person back in. On a shared computer, that
 * person is whoever sits down next. A screen that says "signed out" at that point is wrong.
 *
 * Removing the key yourself is not enough on its own: nothing tells your `onAuthStateChange`
 * listeners or your other tabs, and auth-js's PKCE verifiers stay behind. So after removing it,
 * this calls `signOut({ scope: "local" })`. That call finds no session, skips `/logout`, and runs
 * auth-js's own cleanup: every key it owns, and one `SIGNED_OUT` to every listener.
 *
 * It waits on auth for {@link SIGN_OUT_TIMEOUT_MS} at most. Offline with an expired token,
 * `signOut()` first sits in auth-js's refresh backoff, which measured 15 s at 2.108.2 through
 * 2.116.0 and 41–51 s at 2.106.2. Nobody at a shared computer waits that long, and a page that
 * navigates away in the meantime takes the removal with it.
 *
 * It resolves once the stored session is gone. `error` is `null` when auth ended the session on
 * the server too. Otherwise it is the reason auth did not — its error, a thrown value, or the
 * deadline — and the session may still be live on the server and on other devices. `SIGNED_OUT`
 * arrives once auth-js has finished with the first call: about 100 ms later from 2.108.2 on, and
 * up to 22 s later at 2.106.2. If your screen does not reload, clear your own store when this
 * resolves instead of waiting for the event.
