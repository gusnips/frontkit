/**
 * The HTTP envelope an API and its clients agree on.
 *
 * Every route answers one of two shapes — `{data, meta?}` or `{error:{…}}` — so unwrapping
 * and error-shaping belong in one place rather than in every hook. This module is that
 * place, and it is deliberately types plus three tiny functions: the API server produces
 * the envelope, the browser client consumes it, and an agent reads it. A published SDK can
 * compile it too, instead of hand-writing its own copy of the envelope. It carries no
 * framework and no platform for that reason (see `scripts/check-purity.ts`).
 *
 * **The codes are yours, not ours.** Two donor repos had 30 codes and 16 codes respectively,
 * overlapping on nine; the list is an API's vocabulary and belongs to it. Everything here is
 * generic over that union, so a product declares its own codes once and gets the envelope,
 * the status map and the narrowing for free.

 * route is the common case; a metered API passes its own union instead (one donor carries
 * cache/credit counters there, and its rule — a cache hit is free and visibly so — is the
 * kind of thing that must stay in that product).

 *
 * - `code` is what a client switches on. Machine-oriented and stable.
 * - `message` is English, for logs, `curl` output and agents. It is the fallback a client
 *   shows when it cannot do better — never the primary copy for a person.
 * - `messageKey` names the SENTENCE, so a client can localize or re-word a refusal without
 *   the server knowing any language. The server owns the condition; the client owns the prose.
 * - `params` fills that sentence's blanks, and `details` carries what makes a refusal
 *   ACTIONABLE — the `resetAt` on a 429, the plan that lifts a 402. A refusal a caller cannot
 *   act on is a dead end, which is the thing the whole product rule exists to prevent.
