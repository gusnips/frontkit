 * can follow the same rule as the app: it imports nothing, and a generator can copy the file
 * into an SDK whole. Five SDKs in one fleet each wrote their own, and each missed part of it:
 * none retried a 408, none read an explicit `retryAfterSecs: null`, three read the body's wait
 * before the header, and the one that sent an idempotency key retried writes that had none.
 *
 * Every function reads an error by its fields, not its class: `status`, `code`, `details` (the
 * envelope's), and `retryAfterSecs` (the `Retry-After` header, parsed). An error with no HTTP
 * `status` is a request that got no answer at all: offline, DNS, a dropped connection.
