/**
 * What a reader pays in, and how a price reads to them.
 *
 * A product that sells in more than one currency answers the same three questions, and each one is
 * easy to get slightly wrong in a way that charges somebody the wrong amount: which currency does
 * this language pay in, which currency does THIS customer pay in (Stripe bills one customer in one
 * currency, so the first purchase locks it), and how does an amount read next to a language's
 * own conventions. This file holds the rule for each, so they cannot drift apart across products.
 *
 * It does not hold a price. Every amount is set by hand for its market, never converted from
 * another, and that table is the product's catalog.
 *
 * Intl only, no dependency, same as `./time`.
